# eur-lex.europa.eu google chrome plugin

This plugin allows to:

 - search on eur-lex.europa.eu via the `eurlex` shortcut in the search bar
 - show hidden anchors to chapters, articles and annex in the eur-lex documents,
   so that you can easily create permalinks.

# Usage

Once the plugin is installed, the ![EU Flag](icon.png)  will appear on your extension bar.

When you are on eur-lex.europa.eu:

  1. click on the EU flag;
  2. go to the Article or Annex you want to reference: it will be highlighted;
  3. click on it, and the current window will reflect its location, like if
     there were an anchor.

That's it :)
